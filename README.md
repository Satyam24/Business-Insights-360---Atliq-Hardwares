### Importing Data into PowerBI

* As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential.

  
Data Model
* Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
* Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
* Following Good practices of data modeling is a must. Refer to this page to get to know the good practices of Blog
* In this project, we have followed the Snowflake data modeling schema.
